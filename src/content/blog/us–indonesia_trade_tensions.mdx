Despite the imbalance, Indonesia showed increasing interest in regional integration, expressing strong support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as a pathway to greater market access. However, domestic political sensitivities in both countries prevented new bilateral trade agreements. The existing **1996 Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA)** remained the primary mechanism for dialogue, though it lacked binding commitments. This period established the foundation for future trade tensions by highlighting structural imbalances that would become central to later negotiations.

          "**President Trump fulfills campaign promise by withdrawing US from TPP on his third day in office**, dealing a major blow to Indonesia's trade strategy. Indonesia had invested significant diplomatic capital in TPP negotiations, viewing it as a pathway to greater market access and economic integration with the US. The withdrawal left Indonesia without its preferred mechanism for addressing the growing **$13.2 billion trade deficit** with the US. This move signaled the beginning of a more bilateral, reciprocity-focused US trade policy that would eventually lead to direct US-Indonesia tariff confrontations. Indonesia quickly pivoted toward alternative frameworks like RCEP, while maintaining the existing **1996 TIFA** as a dialogue mechanism, though it lacked the comprehensive commitments Indonesia sought.",

Both sides committed to intensify engagement and establish working groups on specific sectors, though no binding agreements were reached.
