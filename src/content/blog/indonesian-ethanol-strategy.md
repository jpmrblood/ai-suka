## Executive Summary

Indonesia is embarking on an ambitious ethanol strategy centered on a mandatory **10% ethanol blend (E10)** in gasoline by 2027. This initiative aims to reduce fuel import dependency, cut carbon emissions, and create new agricultural markets. However, the domestic ethanol industry faces significant capacity gaps, requiring massive investment in production facilities, infrastructure, and price support mechanisms. The government is drawing lessons from its successful biodiesel program while navigating complex challenges in feedstock supply, farmer interests, and economic viability.

## Government Policy and Strategic Framework

### The E10 Mandate: Cornerstone of Energy Independence

The Indonesian government has set an ambitious target to implement **mandatory E10 blending** nationwide by **2027-2028**. This policy represents a strategic extension of the country's highly successful biodiesel program, which has progressed from B10 to B40/B50 blends and significantly reduced diesel imports.

**Key Strategic Pillars:**

- **Domestic Production Development**: Construction of two major ethanol plants - one cassava-based in Bojonegoro (East Java) and one sugarcane-based in Merauke
- **Investment Incentives**: Government promises to attract private sector investment through tax holidays and guaranteed offtake agreements
- **International Knowledge Transfer**: Active collaboration with global leaders, particularly Brazil, for technology and expertise
- **Environmental Goals**: Reduction of carbon emissions to meet Paris Agreement commitments and Enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (ENDC) targets

### Strategic Drivers: Why Ethanol Now?

Indonesia's ethanol push is motivated by critical national priorities:

| Key Driver | Strategic Goal | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Energy Security** | Reduce gasoline import dependence (currently 60% of consumption) | Save foreign exchange and protect against oil price volatility |
| **Environmental Commitment** | Lower carbon emissions | Meet international climate targets |
| **Agricultural Development** | Create new markets for sugarcane, cassava, and corn | Boost farmer incomes and rural economies |
| **Policy Continuity** | Replicate biodiesel success (B40 model) | Build on proven biofuel experience |

## Domestic Industry: Current Capacity vs Future Demand

### Production Capacity Gap Analysis

Indonesia's current ethanol industry is severely underdeveloped for the ambitious E10 mandate:

| Metric | Current Status (2025) | E10 Requirement | Gap |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Production Capacity** | ~303 million liters/year | 2.3-3 billion liters/year | **Massive shortfall** |
| **Fuel-Grade Ethanol** | ~60 million liters/year | Full requirement | **97% deficit** |
| **Operating Plants** | 6 fuel-ethanol capable facilities | Multiple new plants needed | **Infrastructure deficit** |
| **Key Feedstock** | Molasses (sugarcane by-product) | ~12 million tons molasses needed | **Feedstock scarcity** |

### Feedstock Challenges and Competition

The ethanol program faces significant feedstock constraints:

**Primary Feedstock Sources:**
- **Molasses**: Current main source, but limited supply conflicts with sugar production goals
- **Cassava**: Promising alternative, but requires plantation expansion
- **Sugarcane**: Direct use creates tension with national sugar self-sufficiency objectives
- **Corn**: Potential third-generation option, but food security concerns

**Key Challenge**: The government must balance energy goals with agricultural priorities, particularly protecting sugar farmers from import competition while expanding ethanol feedstock production.

## Import Strategy and Trade Policy

### Current Import Landscape

Indonesia maintains restrictive import policies that have limited ethanol inflows:

- **Import Tariff**: 30% duty creates high barriers to entry
- **Import Volume**: Minimal due to policy restrictions and lack of blending mandate
- **Primary Importers**: Companies like PT Merck Chemicals and Panasonic Industrial Components import for non-fuel industrial uses

### Policy Shift: Opening the Import Door

Recent regulatory changes signal a pragmatic approach to bridge the supply gap:

- **Trade Regulation No. 16/2025**: Opens ethanol imports to secure initial E10 supply
- **Temporary Import Strategy**: Government acknowledges need for imports during transition period
- **Farmer Concerns**: Import policy has sparked opposition from sugarcane farmers who fear market disruption

## Infrastructure and Economic Models

### Pertamina's Central Role

The state-owned energy company is leading implementation efforts:

**Pilot Programs and Testing:**
- Testing E5 and E10 blends on motorcycles and vehicles for performance validation
- Assessing engine compatibility and fuel system requirements

**Brazilian Technology Transfer:**
- **Petrobras Partnership**: MoU signed in 2023 for technology transfer and joint research
- **Knowledge Exchange**: Learning from Brazil's world-leading ethanol expertise
- **Geothermal Integration**: Exploring use of Pertamina's geothermal resources for sustainable production

### Key Projects Under Development

**Flagship Initiatives:**

1. **Bojonegoro Integrated Bioethanol Project**: Cassava-based facility in major production region
2. **Merauke Sugarcane Plant**: Large-scale sugarcane ethanol production in Papua
3. **Infrastructure Upgrades**: Pertamina investment in blending facilities and distribution networks

### Economic Viability: The Price Support Challenge

**The Biodiesel Fund Model:**
Indonesia's successful biodiesel program uses a levy system to maintain price competitiveness. A similar mechanism is needed for ethanol:

- **Price Differential**: Domestic ethanol costs exceed gasoline prices
- **Support Mechanism**: Government fund to subsidize the price gap
- **Funding Challenge**: Need to identify sustainable revenue sources (agricultural levies, budget allocation)

## Recent Developments and Challenges

### Policy Updates and Farmer Opposition

**Import Regulation Controversy:**
- **Permendag 16/2025**: Opens ethanol imports, sparking immediate farmer backlash
- **APTRI Response**: Indonesian Sugarcane Farmers Association strongly opposes import policy
