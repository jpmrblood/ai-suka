# Introduction

In a bold move to reshape its energy landscape, the Indonesian government has announced a plan to implement a mandatory 10% bioethanol blend in gasoline (E10) by 2027. This ambitious policy is designed to reduce the nation's heavy dependence on imported fuel, lower carbon emissions, and replicate the monumental success of its biodiesel program. With a targeted implementation date of 2027-2028, the E10 mandate represents a cornerstone of President Prabowo Subianto's energy agenda, signaling a strategic pivot towards homegrown, renewable energy sources. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of Indonesia's ethanol strategy, examining the driving forces, the existing challenges, and the international partnerships that are set to transform the nation's energy ecosystem.

# The Strategic Drivers: Why Indonesia is Insisting on Ethanol

Indonesia's push for bioethanol is not an isolated policy but a calculated strategy driven by urgent national interests.

- **Energy Independence and Fuel Import Reduction**: Indonesia, despite being a significant oil producer, faces a stark reality: it is a net importer of refined fuels. In 2024 alone, the country imported a staggering **202 million barrels of refined fuel** despite being an oil producer . This reliance on foreign fuel exposes the economy to global price volatility and strains national finances. The E10 policy is a direct response to this vulnerability, aiming to displace a portion of gasoline imports with domestically produced biofuel .

- **Economic Benefits and Foreign Exchange Savings**: The government is looking to replicate the proven success of its biodiesel program. According to records from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, the utilization of biodiesel between 2020 and 2025 saved the country an estimated **$40 billion** in foreign exchange by reducing diesel imports . The E10 program is projected to deliver similar economic benefits for the gasoline sector, conserving state revenue and strengthening the national economy.

- **Environmental Commitments**: The ethanol mandate aligns with Indonesia's international climate pledges, including its commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 29% by 2030 under the Paris Agreement . By integrating plant-based fuels into its energy mix, Indonesia aims to lower the carbon footprint of its transportation sector.

# Legal Framework and Policy Implementation

## Regulatory Foundation: MEMR Regulation No. 4/2025

Indonesia's ethanol strategy is backed by a comprehensive legal framework designed to support domestic industry development and ensure successful implementation.

**Key Legal Provisions:**

- **Mandatory Blending Requirements**: The regulation legally enforces biofuel blending with conventional fossil fuels, creating a guaranteed market for ethanol production
- **Import Restrictions**: Prohibition on biofuel imports reinforces commitment to domestic production ecosystem
- **Investment Incentives**: Fiscal and non-fiscal incentives including simplified licensing and tax benefits for biofuel producers
- **Industry Obligations**: Biofuel Business Entities must prioritize domestic production and submit regular compliance reports

This regulatory framework aligns with **Law No. 30 of 2007 on Energy**, which establishes national renewable energy targets (23% by 2025) and provides the legal basis for renewable energy incentives.

## Policy Goals and Implementation Timeline

The government has established clear objectives and a structured approach to achieving the E10 mandate:

| **Policy & Action** | **Key Objective** | **Status/Timeline** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **E10 Fuel Mandate** | Reduce fuel imports & carbon emissions | Targeted for 2027-2028 |
| **Incentives for Plant Development** | Attract investment for domestic production | Tax holidays & guaranteed market offered |
| **International Cooperation (Brazil)** | Technology transfer & knowledge sharing | MoU signed October 2025 |
| **Feedstock Cultivation** | Secure raw material supply (cassava, sugarcane) | 1 million hectares of cassava planned |

## Current Industry Readiness and Capacity Gaps

Despite strong policy support, Indonesia's ethanol industry faces significant challenges in scaling up to meet E10 requirements.

**Production Capacity Analysis:**

| **Metric** | **Current Status** | **E10 Requirement** | **Gap** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Capacity** | 303,325 kiloliters/year | 1.4 million kiloliters/year | **Massive shortfall** |
| **Fuel-Grade Ethanol** | ~60,000 kiloliters/year | Full requirement | **97% deficit** |
| **Feedstock Supply** | 1.6 million tons molasses | 12 million tons needed | **87% shortfall** |

**Investment Challenges:**
- Producers hesitate to upgrade facilities without government purchase guarantees
- High production costs require sustainable price support mechanisms
- Feedstock expansion needs stronger farmer protection from import competition

# Domestic Production and Challenges

A critical look at Indonesia's existing capacity reveals the scale of the task ahead.

- **Current Production Capacity**: Indonesia's domestic fuel ethanol industry is currently very limited. The country has **six plants capable of producing fuel ethanol** with a total capacity of around 290-303 million liters . However, most of this capacity is not utilized for fuel, and the country's industrial ethanol consumption was estimated at only 137 million liters as recently as 2018 . For context, fulfilling the E10 mandate will require a massive **1.4 million kiloliters (1.4 billion liters) of ethanol annually** .

- **Feedstock Strategy**: The government plans to use **cassava and sugarcane** as the main raw materials for ethanol production . This strategy is designed to generate employment and stimulate local economies in agricultural regions. A sugarcane-based ethanol plant is already planned for **Merauke, South Papua**, and a cassava-based facility is in the planning stages .

## Major Hurdles to Overcome

- **The Cost Disparity**: A fundamental challenge is that **domestically produced ethanol is more expensive than gasoline** . Without a price support mechanism, fuel retailers like Pertamina would face significant losses on every liter of E10 sold. While the government has proposed funds to subsidize this price gap in the past, such measures have not been approved by the House of Representatives .

- **Infrastructure and Supply Chain**: Pertamina currently has **limited infrastructure for the blending and supply of ethanol** . This logistical challenge was highlighted in October 2025 when private fuel operators reportedly rejected a shipment of Pertamina's fuel containing 3.5% ethanol due to concerns over product quality and compatibility .

- **Technical Compatibility and Public Awareness**: Despite the infrastructure challenges, the government has confirmed that **all vehicles in Indonesia are technically compatible with fuel containing up to 20% ethanol** . However, a lack of public and industry awareness about ethanol as an oxygenate remains a barrier that needs to be overcome .

# International Cooperation: The Crucial Deal with Brazil

Indonesia is not embarking on this ambitious journey alone. A key partnership with a global biofuel leader is set to provide a critical boost.

- **Knowledge and Technology Transfer**: In October 2025, Indonesia and **Brazil** signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for ethanol cooperation . Brazil, a world leader in sugarcane-based ethanol with nationwide E30 mandates, will provide expertise on implementing ethanol mandates, regulatory frameworks, and production technology . Indonesian delegations have been sent to Brazil for knowledge exchange, and Brazilian experts will visit Indonesia to share their experiences .

**Strategic Context**: The partnership with Brazil provides the technical foundation, but Indonesia's ethanol push is driven by broader strategic goals:
- **Replicating Biodiesel Success**: Indonesia's B40 biodiesel program has saved over **$40 billion** in foreign exchange by reducing diesel imports
- **Addressing Fuel Import Dependency**: In 2024 alone, Indonesia imported **202 million barrels** of refined fuels despite being an oil producer
- **Creating Agricultural Markets**: Ethanol production from cassava, sugarcane, and corn will create new revenue streams for farming communities

- **Foreign Investment**: Minister Lahadalia has indicated that **investors from Brazil are considering building ethanol factories in Indonesia**, a prospect that has grown significantly following the recent agreements . This foreign direct investment is vital for financing the large-scale plants needed to meet the 2027 target.

**Investment Incentives**: The government is promising **tax holidays and guaranteed market access** to attract private investment in ethanol production facilities. The ultimate goal is to achieve complete domestic supply independence by 2027 without relying on imports.

# Recent Developments and Trade Policy

## Import Regulation and Farmer Concerns

A significant development in Indonesia's ethanol strategy is the government's pragmatic approach to securing initial supply through temporary imports.

- **Trade Regulation No. 16/2025**: In early 2025, the government issued a new regulation opening the door for ethanol imports to support the initial phase of the E10 program . This policy shift acknowledges the domestic supply gap and aims to ensure adequate fuel availability during the transition period.

- **Farmer Opposition**: The import regulation has sparked immediate controversy among domestic agricultural stakeholders. The Indonesian Sugarcane Farmers Association (APTRI) has strongly opposed the policy, arguing that:
  - It could undermine the development of domestic ethanol industry before it starts
  - It contradicts national goals of revitalizing the sugar industry
  - The government should prioritize local molasses purchases and support domestic producers

- **Feedstock Diversification**: To address the food-vs-fuel conflict, ongoing research into **second-generation (2G) ethanol** using agricultural residues (rice straw, sugarcane bagasse, wood waste) could provide a sustainable solution without competing with food production.

## Economic Model: Price Support Mechanisms

For the E10 mandate to be economically viable, Indonesia is developing a price support system modeled after its successful biodiesel fund:

- **Biodiesel Fund Template**: The existing biodiesel program uses a levy on palm oil exports to subsidize the price difference between biodiesel and diesel fuel
- **Ethanol Price Support**: A similar mechanism will be needed for ethanol, with funding potentially coming from agricultural commodity levies or state budget allocations
- **Investment Incentives**: The government promises **tax holidays and guaranteed market access** to attract the estimated billions in investment needed for production facilities

# Conclusion and Strategic Outlook

Indonesia's E10 mandate represents a bold vision for energy independence and sustainable development. The partnership with Brazil provides crucial technical expertise, while lessons from the biodiesel program offer a proven implementation model.

## Key Success Factors for 2027 Implementation

**Three Parallel Tracks:**

1. **Domestic Production Scaling**: Rapid expansion from current 303 million liters to 2.3-3 billion liters annually
2. **Economic Model Design**: Sustainable price support mechanisms and investment incentives
3. **Political Economy Management**: Balancing farmer interests with energy security goals

**Strategic Advantages:**
- **Proven Track Record**: B40 biodiesel success demonstrates implementation capability
- **Market Potential**: 202 million barrels of refined fuel imports in 2024 creates massive substitution opportunity
- **Agricultural Synergies**: Ethanol production from cassava, sugarcane, and corn supports rural development

**Critical Challenges:**
- **Cost Competitiveness**: Domestic ethanol production costs exceed gasoline prices without subsidies
- **Infrastructure Readiness**: Limited blending and distribution capabilities
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Farmer opposition to imports must be addressed through domestic industry development

Indonesia's ethanol strategy, while ambitious, aligns with critical national priorities of energy security and economic resilience. The coming years will determine whether the country can successfully replicate its biodiesel success in the gasoline sector and achieve meaningful progress toward energy sovereignty by 2027.

-   **Energy Security & Economic Resilience**: Indonesia currently **imports about 27 million kiloliters of fuel annually**, a massive outflow of foreign exchange and a vulnerability for its economy . The E10 policy directly targets this dependency. The government is looking to replicate the proven success of its biodiesel program, which allowed the country to **halt diesel fuel imports** .
-   **Environmental Commitments**: The ethanol mandate supports Indonesia's international climate pledges, including its commitment under the Paris Agreement to **cut greenhouse gas emissions by 29% by 2030** . Integrating renewable, plant-based fuels is a key strategy to lower the carbon footprint of the massive transportation sector.
-   **Agricultural & Economic Development**: The program is designed to **open up many job opportunities for farming communities** . By using domestic crops like cassava and sugarcane as feedstocks, the government aims to stimulate regional economies and create a new, sustainable agricultural market.

## 🗓️ Policy Framework and Government Strategy

The government is backing its ambition with a concrete timeline and a package of supportive policies.

### The E10 Mandate and Timeline

The official target is for nationwide implementation of the **E10 mandate by 2027-2028** . This follows a history of biofuel targets, including a 2015 roadmap that set a 20% ethanol blend goal for 2025 . The new administration has given this goal renewed focus and a definitive deadline.

### Incentives for Domestic Industry

A critical part of the strategy is to build a domestic ethanol industry from the ground up. To this end, the government plans to offer incentives to companies that establish ethanol plants, including potential **tax holidays and a guaranteed market** for their output . The goal is to ensure the estimated **1.4 million kiloliters of ethanol** needed annually for E10 can be met entirely by domestic production, avoiding import dependence .

### International Cooperation: The Brazil Partnership

Recognizing the scale of the challenge, Indonesia is actively seeking international expertise. A key partnership has been formed with **Brazil**, a global leader in sugarcane-based ethanol . This collaboration involves technology transfer, knowledge exchange, and could even lead to **Brazilian investors building ethanol factories in Indonesia** .

### Protectionist Trade Measures

To protect the nascent domestic industry, the government is implementing supportive trade policies. In September 2025, the Ministry of Trade issued **Regulation No. 32/2025**, which reinstates import controls on ethanol . The stated goal is to **protect local sugarcane farmers** and ensure the domestic market is reserved for local producers . This policy was further reinforced in October 2025 with an amendment that added ethanol-related items to the country's hazardous substances import policy .

## 🏭 The Domestic Industry: Current State and Key Players

Indonesia's domestic fuel ethanol industry is currently in its infancy, presenting both a challenge and an opportunity.

*Table: Indonesia's Ethanol Landscape at a Glance*

| **Aspect** | **Current Status** | **Future Goal / Challenge** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Policy Target** | Limited E5 (5% blend) sales  | Mandatory E10 by 2027  |
| **Production Capacity** | ~290-303 million liters/year total; only a fraction is fuel-grade  | Vastly insufficient for E10 demand |
| **Fuel Ethanol Demand for E10** | Minimal current demand | Estimated **1.4 million kiloliters (1.4 billion liters)/year** required  |
| **Key Feedstock** | Molasses (by-product of sugarcane)  | Diversification to **cassava and corn**; 1 million hectares of cassava planned  |
| **Number of Plants** | 6 plants capable of producing fuel ethanol  | New plants planned, including a major facility in **Merauke, South Papua**  |

## 🚧 Challenges and Hurdles

The path to E10 by 2027 is fraught with significant challenges that the government and industry must overcome.

-   **The Massive Production Gap**: The most glaring challenge is the **yawning gap between future demand and current supply**. With domestic production capacity for fuel-grade ethanol standing at only a fraction of the 1.4 billion liters needed, a monumental scaling effort is required in a very short time .
-   **Economic Viability and Price Disparity**: A fundamental market challenge is that **domestically produced ethanol is more expensive than gasoline** . This means fuel suppliers like Pertamina would face financial losses blending ethanol without a government price support mechanism. A 2016 proposal to subsidize this price gap was not approved by the House of Representatives, and a sustainable solution is still needed .
-   **Infrastructure and Feedstock Constraints**: Pertamina currently has **limited infrastructure for the blending and supply of ethanol** . Furthermore, the primary feedstock, molasses, is in short supply. While Indonesia has enough molasses to produce about **355 million liters of ethanol**, this is still far below the required volume for E10, indicating a need for major expansion in feedstock cultivation .
-   **Regulatory Uncertainty**: As of mid-2025, the Government of Indonesia issued **two conflicting regulations on biofuels**, with one appearing to block imports while the other simplifies them . This regulatory ambiguity could hinder the investment and planning needed for the program's success.

## 🔭 Conclusion and Outlook

Indonesia's E10 mandate is a bold and strategically sound policy with the potential to significantly enhance the nation's energy sovereignty, economic resilience, and environmental standing. The government's full commitment to the 2027 timeline is evident in its offer of investor incentives and its proactive pursuit of international partnerships, particularly with Brazil.

However, the path to success is narrow and fraught with challenges. **Building a domestic ethanol industry from its current nascent state to a level capable of supplying 1.4 billion liters annually within two years is a monumental task.** The success of this endeavor hinges on the government's ability to rapidly address the high cost of production, accelerate infrastructure development, and secure the promised foreign and domestic investments.

If Indonesia can overcome these hurdles, the E10 program will not only reduce its dependency on fuel imports but also create a new, thriving agricultural bio-economy. By leveraging its partnership with Brazil and learning from its own biodiesel success, Indonesia has a viable pathway to achieving its energy goals and setting a new benchmark for biofuel adoption in the region.
