In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, where AI coding assistants have become indispensable collaborators, a fundamental challenge persists: ensuring that humans and AI systems share a precise, unambiguous understanding of requirements before implementation begins. **This challenge manifests as "AI drift" - where you start with a clear request, but five prompts later, the AI is building something slightly different, with your original requirements lost in the chat history.**

OpenSpec emerges as a comprehensive solution to this challenge, introducing a structured approach to spec-driven development that prioritizes clarity, validation, and systematic evolution. **Think of it as a "seatbelt" for AI-assisted development** - a lightweight framework that ensures alignment between humans and AI agents on *what* to build *before* any code is written.

## The Alignment Problem in AI-Assisted Development

Modern software development teams face unprecedented challenges when working with AI coding assistants:

- **Ambiguous Requirements**: Natural language descriptions that can be interpreted differently by humans and AI
- **Scope Creep**: Features that expand beyond initial intentions during implementation
- **Communication Gaps**: Misunderstandings between team members and AI assistants about intended functionality
- **Validation Difficulties**: Lack of systematic processes to verify that implemented code matches requirements

These challenges become particularly acute in complex projects where multiple stakeholders, changing requirements, and sophisticated AI assistance intersect.

## OpenSpec: A Structured Solution

OpenSpec introduces a comprehensive framework for spec-driven development that treats specifications as the single source of truth. At its core, OpenSpec establishes clear conventions for documenting, validating, and evolving software requirements in a format that both humans and AI assistants can understand and act upon.

### Core Philosophy: Specifications First

The fundamental principle of OpenSpec centers on the concept that "specifications are the source of truth." This approach ensures that:

1. **Requirements are explicit** before any code is written
2. **All stakeholders align** on intended functionality
3. **Changes are systematic** and well-documented
4. **Implementation matches** documented specifications

### Greenfield vs Brownfield: A Critical Distinction

OpenSpec's architecture is specifically designed to excel at "brownfield" development (modifying existing systems) rather than just "greenfield" development (building from scratch). This makes it particularly valuable for:

- **Existing codebases** where you need to modify or extend current functionality
- **Complex systems** requiring careful change management
- **Team environments** where multiple developers need to understand proposed changes
- **AI-assisted workflows** where maintaining context across multiple sessions is challenging

The two-folder system (`specs/` vs `changes/`) elegantly handles this by separating the current "source of truth" from proposed modifications.

## The OpenSpec Project Structure

OpenSpec organizes project information in a clear, hierarchical structure that separates current capabilities from proposed changes:

```
openspec/
├── project.md              # Project context and conventions
├── specs/                  # Current implemented capabilities
│   └── [capability]/       # Focused capability specifications
├── changes/                # Proposed modifications
│   ├── [change-name]/      # Individual change proposals
│   └── archive/            # Completed changes for reference
```

### Specifications: Documenting Current Capabilities

The `specs/` directory contains the current state of implemented features, organized by capability. Each specification follows a structured format:

```markdown
### Requirement: Clear requirement statement
The system SHALL provide specific functionality...

#### Scenario: Descriptive scenario name
- **WHEN** a specific condition occurs
- **THEN** the expected outcome happens
- **AND** any additional requirements are met
```

This format ensures that requirements are:
- **Clear and unambiguous**
- **Testable and verifiable**
- **Structured for AI processing**

### Changes: Managing Evolution

The `changes/` directory manages proposed modifications through a systematic workflow:

#### Change Proposal Structure
Each proposed change includes:
- **`proposal.md`**: Why, what, and impact of the proposed change
- **`tasks.md`**: Implementation checklist and progress tracking
- **`spec-deltas/`**: Specific modifications to existing specifications

## The OpenSpec CLI: Powering the Workflow

OpenSpec provides a comprehensive command-line interface that streamlines the development workflow:

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Project management
openspec init [path]        # Initialize OpenSpec in your project
openspec update [path]      # Update agent instructions and structure

# Exploration and inspection
openspec list              # List active changes
openspec list --specs      # List all specifications
openspec show [item]       # Display details of changes or specs

# Validation and quality assurance
openspec validate [item]   # Validate changes or specifications
openspec diff [change]     # Show proposed modifications

# Change management
openspec archive [change]  # Archive completed changes
```

### Advanced Validation Features

The validation system provides multiple modes:
- **Standard validation**: Basic syntax and structure checking

- **THEN** expected result occurs
```

#### **MODIFIED Requirements**
```markdown
## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Updated Feature
The system SHALL provide enhanced functionality...

#### Scenario: Updated behavior
- **WHEN** modified conditions occur
- **THEN** updated outcomes happen
```

#### **REMOVED Requirements**
```markdown
## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Deprecated Feature
**Reason**: No longer needed due to architectural changes
**Migration**: Users should migrate to alternative feature
```

## How OpenSpec Compares to Alternatives

OpenSpec differentiates itself from other specification tools in the AI development ecosystem:

### **vs. Spec-Driven Tools (spec-kit, Kiro.dev)**
While these tools excel at "greenfield" development (building from scratch), OpenSpec's two-folder architecture (`specs/` vs `changes/`) is specifically designed for "brownfield" development. It groups all assets for a single feature change in one folder, making it easier to track modifications to existing systems.

### **vs. Traditional Documentation**
Unlike static documentation that becomes outdated, OpenSpec creates a living specification that evolves with your codebase. The delta system ensures that what's documented matches what's implemented.

### **vs. Chat-Only AI Workflows**
OpenSpec brings predictability, auditability, and collaboration to processes that would otherwise be defined by temporary chat history. It transforms AI-driven development from chaotic sprints into deterministic, reviewable engineering processes.
