Germany's decision to rearm its military—the Bundeswehr—represents a significant shift in European security dynamics. Triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, this rearmament is shaped by geopolitical pressures, domestic policy changes, and external influence, particularly from the U.S. under President Donald Trump. This analysis explores why Germany is rearming, what it entails, the challenges involved, and its broader implications for Europe and NATO.

## Why Germany is Rearming

Several strategic factors drive Germany's renewed military buildup. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 served as a major wake-up call for Germany, overturning previous assumptions of peace in Europe and prompting a need to step up its defence posture [1]. Germany faces pressure from NATO and its allies to assume a greater role in European defence, both in terms of capabilities and spending [2]. Under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, a domestic political shift aims to make Germany's conventional army the strongest in Europe [3].

In the decades after the Cold War, Germany's military was downsized and focused on peacekeeping rather than homeland defence, with significant reductions in tank numbers and artillery [4]. Many observers argue that the Bundeswehr was largely inadequate at the outset of the Ukraine war [5].

Fiscal enablers include amendments to Germany's debt brake, freeing up funds for defence and security [6]. The German arms-industry strategy signals a shift toward greater domestic production and readiness [7].

## What Germany Plans to Do

Germany aims to increase its armed forces from approximately 203,000 to perhaps 230,000 troops to meet new NATO requirements [8]. The army is being reformed to include significant expansions, with memos suggesting it must more than double in size from its current 62,000 active Land Forces to meet readiness goals [9].

Defensive posture changes include deploying a permanent brigade to Lithuania for the first time since WWII to reinforce NATO's eastern flank [10]. Structurally, the Bundeswehr will restructure command, increase readiness for high-intensity conflict, and merge domestic and foreign operational commands [11].

Capability upgrades encompass major procurements of artillery systems, digital networks, air defence, and army mechanisation [12]. The defence industry strategy emphasises long-term contracts, R&D, supply-chain security, and domestic production of key systems [7].

## Challenges Germany Faces

Despite ambitious plans, Germany contends with major shortfalls, with analyses suggesting the Bundeswehr will struggle to meet readiness deadlines [13]. Equipment readiness is low, with many helicopters, howitzers, and other systems non-operational [14].

Recruitment difficulties persist, with dropouts high within initial months [15]. Scaling up personnel in a short timeframe is challenging [16].

Financial and industrial constraints risk delaying under-funded programmes, requiring Germany to rebuild defence production capabilities [17]. Domestic and political friction arises from post-WWII traditions emphasising defence, creating unease over a large conventional army [18].

## Implications for Germany, Europe, and NATO

Germany's rearmament repositions it as a major European military power, shifting its strategic role significantly [19]. Risks include cost overruns, reputational concerns like perceptions of German militarism, and challenges in civil-military relations [20].

For Europe and NATO, Germany's commitment bolsters the eastern flank and deters aggressors, encouraging burden-sharing among other nations [21]. However, if Germany falters in delivery, it could undermine credibility [22].

Germany's emergence as a stronger conventional force signals potential European strategic autonomy, reducing reliance on the U.S. [23]. Russia may view this as escalation, possibly affecting deterrence dynamics [24]. Germany's arms industry revival could influence export flows and joint European defence projects [25].

## Outlook

Germany faces an ambitious path toward achieving its military ambitions, with successes depending on overcoming recruitment, industrial, and political hurdles. The goal of becoming Europe's most powerful conventional army will require consistent effort across personnel, equipment, and industry. Yet, the strategic necessity from Russia's actions provides strong impetus for change.

## U.S. Influence and Germany's Response

The U.S., particularly under President Donald Trump, exerted significant pressure on Germany to increase defence spending. Trump repeatedly urged NATO allies, including Germany, to reach higher GDP percentages for defence [26]. In May 2025, Germany backed Trump's push for 5% GDP defence spending in principle [27].

Germany's response evolved, with initial resistance under Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who deemed the 5% target too costly [28]. Later, under Merz, Germany aligned more closely, with Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul stating they would follow Trump's demands [29].

While U.S. pressure catalyzed shifts—through public critiques and troop-deployment leverage—Germany frames its changes as driven by strategic needs, such as the Russian threat, rather than solely U.S. influence [30]. This balance of external pressure and internal drivers shapes Germany's defence policy.
