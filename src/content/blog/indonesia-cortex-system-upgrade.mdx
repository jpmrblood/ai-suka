## Introduction

In a recent discussion, officials outlined significant improvements to Indonesia's Coretax system, a critical software platform. The updates address multiple layers, enhance security, and boost performance, leveraging local expertise.

## System Layers and Fixes

The Coretax system comprises several layers, each targeted for optimization:

### Upper Layer
- Issues: Frequent timeouts, login failures due to poor internet connectivity via Telkom.
- Fix: Switched traffic to Lintas Arta for stable connections.

### Middle Layer
- Issues: Session and cookie management problems, lack of CDN, overkill security policies.
- Fix: Applied configurations for session management, adjusted security to focus on core protections.

### Programming Layer
- Issues: Error messages, data inconsistencies, slow access.
- Fix: Partially resolved; recommendations sent to LG for patches. Full access expected in December.

### Operational Layer
- Issues: Slow data loading, timeouts during peak hours.
- Fix: Under review for operational management improvements.

## Security Enhancements

Cybersecurity has seen dramatic improvements:
- Score improved from 30/100 to 95+.
- Engaged top Indonesian hackers for testing and fixes.
- Prevented data leaks and unauthorized access.

## Performance Metrics

- Non-transactional performance: Achieved 95+ out of 100.
- Overall system speed and reliability enhanced significantly.

## Future Plans and Insights

- Full code access in January 2026 for complete overhaul.
- Code quality from LG noted as subpar; local team to take over.
- No additional costs; existing staff and strengthened team handling upgrades.

## Conclusion

The Coretax system upgrades demonstrate Indonesia's capability in managing complex technologies, reducing foreign dependencies, and achieving high standards in security and performance.
