## Introduction

Indonesia's Coretax system, a core component of the country's tax administration infrastructure, has undergone significant enhancements as detailed by officials in a recent video discussion. Coretax is Indonesia's centralized tax information system designed to manage tax collection, compliance, and enforcement processes. The speaker, Mr. Purbaya, highlighted a multi-layered approach to addressing systemic issues, improving security, and boosting performance. This analysis delves into the technical challenges, solutions implemented, and broader implications for Indonesia's digital sovereignty and operational efficiency.

## Technical Architecture and Layered Fixes

The Coretax system is structured in multiple layers, each with specific functions and vulnerabilities. Mr. Purbaya described targeted improvements across these layers:

### Upper Layer: Network and Connectivity Issues
The upper layer primarily deals with user access and basic connectivity. Key problems included frequent timeouts and login failures, often traced to unreliable internet connections via Telkom, Indonesia's primary telecom provider.

- **Issues Identified**: Core network instability led to session drops, preventing users from accessing the system or continuing workflows post-login.
- **Solutions Implemented**: Traffic was rerouted to Lintas Arta, an alternative provider, to ensure stable connectivity. This switch addressed immediate access problems and improved overall system reliability.
- **Impact**: Reduced user frustration and increased uptime, allowing for smoother tax-related transactions.

### Middle Layer: Application and Security Management
This layer handles session management, content delivery, and security protocols. Issues here stemmed from poor programming practices and overly restrictive security measures.

- **Issues Identified**: Session and cookie management failures caused pages to redirect or go blank, while the absence of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) slowed data retrieval. Security was overly aggressive, blocking legitimate access without focusing on core threats.
- **Solutions Implemented**: Configurations were applied to streamline session handling and adjust security policies to prioritize application protection over blanket restrictions. An application firewall was reconfigured to balance security with usability.
- **Impact**: Enhanced user experience with faster page loads and fewer access denials, while maintaining robust protection against threats.

### Programming Layer: Code Quality and Logic
At the programming level, errors in code logic led to inconsistent data handling and user-facing issues like erroneous error messages.

- **Issues Identified**: Applications displayed misleading error pop-ups despite processing in the background, data values fluctuated, and case management was suboptimal, causing delays.
- **Solutions Implemented**: Partial fixes were applied through patches, with recommendations forwarded to LG (the original vendor). Full access to source code is expected in December for comprehensive improvements.
- **Impact**: While not fully resolved, these patches have reduced error rates and improved data accuracy, with plans for deeper refactoring.

### Operational Layer: Data Management and Performance
The operational layer focuses on data processing and system performance during peak usage.

- **Issues Identified**: Large data retrievals during busy periods caused timeouts and slow displays, affecting overall efficiency.
- **Solutions Implemented**: Operational management is under review, with strategies being developed to optimize data handling and resource allocation.
- **Impact**: Gradual improvements in processing times, setting the stage for better scalability.

## Cybersecurity Enhancements: From Vulnerability to Fortification

Mr. Purbaya emphasized a remarkable turnaround in cybersecurity, elevating the system's security score from 30/100 to 95+.

- **Initial State**: The system was prone to data breaches, with reports of information being sold externally.
- **Improvements**: Engaged elite Indonesian hackers—ranked among the world's best—to identify and fix vulnerabilities. This local expertise ensured culturally and contextually appropriate solutions.
- **Outcomes**: Achieved near-impenetrable status, preventing unauthorized access and data leaks. The focus on local talent underscores Indonesia's growing cybersecurity capabilities.

## Performance Metrics and User Experience

Performance has seen a parallel improvement:

- **Metrics**: Non-transactional performance jumped from 0 to 95+, indicating significant gains in speed and reliability.
- **Broader Impact**: Reduced errors, faster response times, and enhanced user satisfaction, making tax compliance more efficient.

## Strategic Implications and Future Directions

The upgrades to Coretax have broader implications beyond technical fixes:

### Reducing Foreign Dependencies
- **Vendor Issues**: LG's code was criticized for poor quality, described as "high school level." Delays in responses highlighted over-reliance on foreign vendors.
- **Local Empowerment**: By strengthening internal teams and planning to take full control in January 2026, Indonesia is fostering self-sufficiency in critical IT infrastructure.

### Cost Efficiency
- **Budget Management**: No additional costs were incurred; improvements were made using existing staff and resources, demonstrating efficient resource utilization.

### Team Development
- **Talent Utilization**: Existing teams, though talented, lacked direction. Through targeted guidance, their skills were harnessed effectively, avoiding the need for new hires.

### Timeline of Key Events
To visualize the progression, here's a timeline of major developments:

## Analysis and Insights

Mr. Purbaya's discussion reveals several key insights:

1. **Technical Debt**: The system's issues stem from initial poor design and vendor limitations, common in government IT projects.
2. **Local Innovation**: Leveraging Indonesian talent for cybersecurity shows the country's potential in high-tech fields.
3. **Strategic Autonomy**: The push to reduce LG's involvement aligns with broader goals of digital sovereignty.
4. **Scalability**: Improvements ensure the system can handle increasing demands as Indonesia's economy grows.

## Conclusion

The Coretax system overhaul represents a pivotal moment for Indonesia's digital infrastructure. By addressing technical flaws, enhancing security, and promoting local expertise, the upgrades not only improve operational efficiency but also pave the way for greater technological independence. As full control is assumed, further optimizations are expected, potentially setting a model for other developing nations.
