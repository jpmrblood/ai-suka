## 2016
- **Trade context under Obama:**  
  U.S. goods exports to Indonesia were rising but still modest (about **$6 B** in 2016); the U.S. ran a goods trade deficit of about **$13.2 B**.[^1]  
  Indonesia expressed interest in regional trade pacts (e.g. TPP) during this period, but no new bilateral deal was reached.

## 2017
- **Early Trump era:**  
  In January 2017, President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a deal Indonesia had hoped to join.  
  The relationship continued under the **1996 Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA)**.  
  In June, USTR Robert Lighthizer met Indonesian officials under TIFA; both sides “agreed to intensify engagement” on trade issues including agriculture, high-tech products, and intellectual property, aiming to address the U.S. trade deficit.[^2][^3]

## 2018
- **TIFA talks:**  
  In May 2018, the U.S. and Indonesia met again under TIFA in Jakarta. They pledged to cooperate on **agriculture, digital trade, financial services, fisheries, labor, environment, insurance, and IP**.[^4]  
  Indonesia agreed to adopt an IP workplan, and signaled interest in greater U.S. investment.  
  Throughout this period, Indonesia remained on the USTR “Special 301” watchlist for IP concerns.

## 2019–2021
- **Regional trade shifts:**  
  - Indonesia signed the **Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)** in 2020.  
  - Under the **Biden administration (2021)**, the U.S. launched the **Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)** in May 2022, with Indonesia as a founding member.[^5]  
  - President Biden and President Jokowi met at the **G20 Bali Summit** (Nov 2022), reaffirming ties but with no bilateral FTA.[^6]  
  - U.S.–Indonesia trade remained imbalanced: by **2024**, total trade hit **$38.2 B** (U.S. exports $10.2 B vs imports $28.1 B).[^7]

## 2023
- **Geopolitical realignment:**  
  Indonesia accepted an invitation to join **BRICS** (effective Jan 2025).[⁸]  
  The U.S. viewed BRICS alignment cautiously; by mid-2025 Trump proposed a **10% tariff** on BRICS nations pursuing “anti-American” policies.[⁹]  
  Simultaneously, Indonesia applied to join **CPTPP** (Sept 2024).[¹⁰]

## 2024
- **Pre-election and EU alignment:**  
  President Trump won re-election (Nov 2024) emphasizing protectionism.  
  Indonesia prepared for possible tariff friction by deepening trade talks with the **EU**, culminating later in 2025 in a CEPA deal.  
  U.S.–Indonesia TIFA discussions continued quietly without major new accords.

## 2025

### April 2025 — The Tariff Shock
- **Executive Order 14257 ("Liberation Day Tariffs")**  
  On **April 2, 2025**, Trump announced “reciprocal tariffs” — a **32% tariff** on Indonesian goods to take effect in July (with a 90-day negotiation window).[^11]  
  Indonesia scrambled to respond diplomatically.

- **April 16–23:**  
  A high-level Indonesian delegation (Airlangga Hartarto, Sri Mulyani) met with USTR, Commerce, State, and Treasury in Washington.  
  Indonesia offered to increase imports of U.S. products and purchase U.S. agricultural commodities (wheat, soy, cotton, energy).[^12]

---

### July 2025 — Negotiation and Partial Breakthrough
- **July 7:**  
  Trump issued an ultimatum via social media threatening the 32% tariff effective **August 1**, unless Indonesia agreed to concessions.[¹³]

- **July 10–15:**  
  Intensive talks led to a **framework agreement**:  
  - The U.S. reduced the planned tariff to **19%**.  
  - Indonesia agreed to **eliminate 99% of tariffs** on U.S. goods and **commit to $18-19 B in purchases**:  
    - $3.2 B in Boeing aircraft  
    - $4.5 B in agriculture  
    - $15 B in energy[¹⁴][¹⁵]  
  - The U.S. paused tariff implementation for 3 weeks to finalize terms.[¹⁶]

- **July 22–23:**  
  The **White House Fact Sheet** confirmed Indonesia’s reciprocal 19% rate and market-opening steps:  
  - Dropping tariffs on U.S. goods  
  - Lifting pre-shipment inspection rules  
  - Recognizing U.S. automotive and pharma standards[¹⁷]

---

### August 2025 — Implementation & Exemptions
- **Aug 7:**  
  The **19% U.S. tariff** formally took effect.[¹⁸]  
  Days later, Indonesia’s negotiators confirmed the U.S. had agreed *in principle* to **exempt palm oil, rubber, and cocoa** — commodities the U.S. does not produce.[¹⁹]

---

### September 2025 — EU CEPA as Counterbalance
- **Sept 23:**  
  Indonesia and the **European Union** concluded the **Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)**, removing tariffs on over 90% of trade.[²⁰]  
  Analysts described this as a strategic move to **offset Trump-era tariffs**.  
  The deal awaits ratification by EU member states and Parliament.

---

### October 2025 — The Pending Agreement
- **Virtual Negotiations:**  
  Indonesia and the USTR continued drafting the **Agreement on Reciprocal Trade (ART)**, the legal form of the July framework.[²¹]  
  Talks paused briefly due to a **U.S. government shutdown** (Oct 1-10).[²²]

- **Status:**  
  - The 19% tariff remains in effect as an interim measure.  
  - Exemptions for **palm oil, rubber, and cocoa** confirmed but not yet codified.  
  - Ratification expected in **mid-2026**.[²³]

---

## Economic and Strategic Consequences

- **Trade Impact (2024):**  
  U.S.–Indonesia trade reached **$38.2 B**; U.S. deficit ~**$17.9 B**.[⁷]

- **Key Sectors:**  
  - *Indonesia exports:* palm oil, natural rubber, seafood (shrimp), footwear, electronics.  
  - *U.S. exports:* aircraft, machinery, soybeans, energy, digital services.  
  - Palm oil, rubber, and cocoa gained exemption commitments.[¹⁹]  
  - U.S. energy exports expected to rise sharply after the $15 B pledge.[¹⁴]

- **Geopolitical Context:**  
  The U.S. sought “reciprocity” as part of its Indo-Pacific trade recalibration, while Indonesia balanced relations through BRICS and the EU CEPA.  
  Analysts noted that the Trump–Prabowo negotiations, though tense, ultimately avoided a trade rupture and set the stage for structured bilateral reciprocity by 2026.[²⁴]
