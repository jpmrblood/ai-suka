## Introduction

AI development workflows often hit context limits when a single agent tries to handle planning, implementation, testing, and documentation simultaneously. This leads to context drift, debugging overhead, and overwhelming complexity. The solution lies in creating a modular agent system that scales while keeping each agent focused on specific tasks.

## The Problem with Single-Agent Workflows

Traditional AI development approaches often involve one primary agent handling multiple responsibilities:

- Task planning and breakdown
- Code implementation
- Quality review and testing
- Documentation updates
- Bug fixing and debugging

As conversations grow longer, the main agent's context becomes convoluted, leading to:
- **Context drift** - losing focus on original requirements
- **Quality degradation** - missing edge cases and implementation details
- **Debugging overhead** - spending more time fixing than building

## Modular Agent Architecture Solution

The modular approach introduces two types of specialized agents working in coordination:

### Primary Agent (Orchestrator)
- **Role**: Coordinates the overall workflow and big-picture understanding
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Breaks down complex tasks into manageable components
  - Delegates work to appropriate subagents
  - Validates and integrates results from subagents
  - Maintains high-level project context
- **Context**: Full project overview and architectural decisions

### Subagents (Specialists)
- **Role**: Handle specific tasks with focused expertise
- **Types**:
  - **Planning Agent**: Creates detailed implementation roadmaps
  - **Task Manager**: Breaks down tasks into actionable steps
  - **Code Reviewer**: Ensures code quality and best practices
  - **Testing Agent**: Validates functionality and writes tests
  - **Documentation Agent**: Updates and formats documentation

## OpenCode Agent Configuration

OpenCode provides two methods to set up your agent system:

### Method 1: JSON Configuration

Create an `opencode.json` config file:

```json
{
  "mode": "primary",
  "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "tools": ["read_file", "write_to_file", "execute_command"],
  "prompt": "You are the primary orchestrator..."
}
```

### Method 2: Markdown Configuration (Recommended)

Create agent files in `.opencode/agents/` directory:

```markdown
---
mode: primary
model: claude-3-5-sonnet
temperature: 0.7
tools: [read_file, write_to_file, execute_command]
---

# Primary Agent Prompt

You are the primary orchestrator for AI development projects...
```

## Recommended Workflow Structure

The optimal workflow follows a systematic progression:

1. **Planning Phase** (Planning Agent)
   - Analyze requirements and project state
   - Create detailed implementation roadmap
   - Break down into actionable tasks

2. **Implementation Phase** (Task Manager + Code Agent)
   - Execute tasks in logical order
   - Make code changes systematically
   - Maintain implementation consistency

3. **Review Phase** (Review Agent)
   - Code quality assessment
   - Best practices validation
   - Performance optimization suggestions

4. **Testing Phase** (Testing Agent)
   - Write comprehensive tests
   - Validate functionality
   - Ensure edge case coverage

5. **Documentation Phase** (Documentation Agent)
   - Update README and code comments
   - Create usage examples
   - Document architectural decisions

## Context Management Benefits

This architecture provides several key advantages:

### Focused Context
Each agent receives only relevant context for its specific task, preventing information overload and maintaining clarity.

### Scalable Architecture
Add new specialized agents as your project grows without affecting existing agent performance.

### Consistent Quality
Specialized agents develop expertise in their domain, leading to more consistent and higher-quality outputs.

### Reduced Debugging
Clear separation of concerns makes it easier to identify and fix issues in specific areas.

## Implementation Example

Here's how to set up a basic modular agent system:

### 1. Create Agent Directory Structure

```
.opencode/
├── agents/
│   ├── primary-agent.md
│   └── subagents/
│       ├── planner.md
│       ├── task-manager.md
│       ├── reviewer.md
│       └── tester.md
```

### 2. Configure Primary Agent

```markdown
---
mode: primary
model: claude-3-5-sonnet
temperature: 0.3
tools: [list_files, read_file, search_files]
---

# Primary Orchestrator

You coordinate AI development workflows by:
1. Breaking down complex tasks into manageable components
2. Delegating work to appropriate subagents
3. Validating and integrating results
4. Maintaining project-level context

Always follow this workflow:
- Plan → Task → Implement → Review → Test → Document
```

### 3. Configure Subagents

Each subagent should specify its location for the primary agent to find:

```markdown
---
mode: subagent
model: claude-3-5-sonnet
temperature: 0.7
tools: [read_file, write_to_file, execute_command]
location: subagents/planner.md
---

# Planning Agent

Create detailed implementation plans and break down complex tasks...
```

## Model Selection Strategy

Different agents benefit from different model characteristics:

- **Planning Agent**: Use creative models (Gemini 2.5 Flash) for innovative solutions
- **Task Manager**: Use reliable models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for consistent breakdown
- **Code Reviewer**: Use analytical models (GPT-4) for thorough code analysis
- **Testing Agent**: Use precise models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for accurate validation

## Authentication Setup

Ensure all required API keys are configured:

```bash
opencode auth login
# Follow prompts for each provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.)
```

## Best Practices

### Agent Communication
- Use clear, structured prompts for each agent
- Specify exact file locations for subagents
- Include relevant context without overwhelming details

### Context Boundaries
- Give each agent only the context it needs
- Use project documentation for persistent context
- Avoid passing implementation details between planning phases

### Error Handling
- Implement validation steps between agent handoffs
- Use review agents to catch integration issues
- Maintain clear error reporting and debugging trails

## Real-World Application

This system was successfully demonstrated by creating a Snake game from scratch:

1. **Planning**: Analyzed requirements and created game architecture
2. **Task Management**: Broke down into 17 actionable tasks across 3 phases
3. **Implementation**: Built game mechanics, UI, and controls
4. **Review**: Validated code quality and performance
5. **Testing**: Ensured game functionality and edge cases

The result was a fully functional Snake game with proper game mechanics, scoring, and responsive controls.

## Conclusion

Modular agent systems represent a significant improvement over single-agent workflows by:

- **Preventing context overload** through focused responsibilities
- **Improving code quality** with specialized expertise
- **Scaling development teams** without coordination overhead
- **Reducing debugging time** through clear separation of concerns

This architecture transforms AI development from an overwhelming single-threaded conversation into a coordinated team of specialized agents working toward a common goal.

The key is finding the right balance between agent specialization and workflow coordination, ensuring each agent has clear responsibilities while maintaining smooth handoffs between phases.
