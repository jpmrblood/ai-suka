## Executive Summary

Indonesia's government at both central and regional levels is sitting on a massive **Rp653.4 trillion** in accumulated wealth, according to the latest data from Q3 2025. This unprecedented accumulation of idle funds has sparked a major controversy between Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa and West Java Governor Dedi Mulyadi, highlighting fundamental issues in fiscal management and budget execution across the archipelago.

## The Scale of Government Wealth Accumulation

### Total Government Deposits: Rp653.4 Trillion

According to data released by the Ministry of Finance and Bank Indonesia for August/September 2025, total government deposits in the national banking system have reached staggering levels:

#### Composition Breakdown
- **Time Deposits (Deposito)**: **Rp285.6 trillion**
- **Current Accounts (Giro)**: **Rp357.4 trillion**
- **Savings Accounts**: **Rp10.4 trillion**

This accumulation represents a significant portion of Indonesia's GDP and raises serious questions about fiscal efficiency and economic productivity.

## Deep Analysis: Two Faces of Fund Accumulation

### 1. Intentional Hoarding: Time Deposits (Rp285.6T)

The **Rp285.6 trillion** in time deposits represents a clear case of intentional fund accumulation:

**Economic Implications:**
- These funds are deliberately placed in interest-bearing instruments rather than being allocated for public spending
- Represents excess budget (SILPA) from previous years or unallocated regional income
- Local governments are choosing to earn interest rather than spend on development projects

**Macroeconomic Impact:**
- Creates "unproductive" capital that doesn't contribute to economic growth
- Slows money circulation and reduces the fiscal multiplier effect
- Funds that could be building infrastructure, paying teachers, or providing social assistance remain idle in banks

### 2. Execution Incompetence: Current Accounts (Rp357.4T)

The **Rp357.4 trillion** in current accounts presents an even more concerning picture:

**Operational Issues:**
- These are operational funds that should be highly liquid and ready for expenditure
- The fact that current accounts exceed time deposits suggests severe cash management problems
- Indicates failure in budget execution despite having available funds

**Efficiency Concerns:**
- Funds in current accounts earn minimal or zero interest
- Represents acute inefficiency in budget planning and procurement processes
- Shows inability to execute planned spending, leading to very slow budget absorption rates

## Regional Concentration: Where the Money Piles Up

The fund accumulation problem is heavily concentrated in wealthier regions with high fiscal capacity:

### Leading Accumulators
- **DKI Jakarta**: **Rp14.6 trillion** - the highest in the nation
- **West Java**: **Rp4.17-4.7 trillion** - fourth highest nationally
- **Samarinda City**: **Rp1.48 trillion** - significant even at city level

This creates an ironic situation where Indonesia's most economically capable regions become the largest "savers" rather than drivers of economic growth.

## The Purbaya vs Dedi Mulyadi Controversy

### Minister Purbaya's Aggressive Stance

Finance Minister Purbaya has taken an unusually confrontational approach to address this issue:

**Key Actions:**
- Publicly criticized regional governments for "parking" APBD funds in banks
- Specifically called out the inefficiency of keeping funds in low-interest current accounts
- Warned that such practices would be flagged in BPK (Supreme Audit Agency) inspections
- Pushed for immediate spending to stimulate economic growth

**Strategic Moves:**
- Injected **Rp200 trillion** of government funds into state-owned banks (Himbara) to boost liquidity and lower interest rates
- Aiming for double-digit credit growth by year-end
- Working to resolve Coretax system issues by January 2026

### Governor Dedi Mulyadi's Defense

West Java Governor Dedi Mulyadi has responded with transparency and direct action:

**Counterarguments:**
- Denied the existence of **Rp4.17 trillion** in "idle" deposits
- Clarified that remaining funds (Rp2.3 trillion as of October 21, 2025) are in current accounts for operational needs
- Explained funds are allocated for project payments, salaries, and routine expenditures

**Verification Steps:**
- Visited Bank Indonesia offices to verify data accuracy
- Requested BPK audit for transparent examination of regional cash management
- Emphasized that remaining budget is normal for year-end operations

## Broader Economic and Political Implications

### Economic Consequences
- **Reduced Fiscal Multiplier**: Idle funds don't contribute to economic growth
- **Inefficient Resource Allocation**: Capital that could be invested in infrastructure remains unproductive
- **Slow Budget Absorption**: Indicates deeper issues in planning and procurement processes

### Political Ramifications
- **Center-Regional Tensions**: Highlights ongoing friction between central and regional governments
- **Transparency Demands**: Public scrutiny of government fund management has intensified
- **Accountability Pressure**: Both central and regional officials face increased accountability demands

## Data Sources and Verification

The analysis is based on official data from multiple verified sources:

1. **Bank Indonesia & Ministry of Finance Reports**: Total deposits of Rp653.4 trillion
2. **Regional Budget Documents**: Specific figures for DKI Jakarta (Rp14.6T), West Java (Rp4.17-4.7T), Samarinda (Rp1.48T)
3. **News Reports**: Coverage from Kompas.com, RRI.co.id, Infobanknews.com, CNBC Indonesia, Tempo.co

## Government Response and Policy Direction

### Central Government Initiatives
- **Liquidity Injection**: Rp200 trillion placement in state banks
- **System Improvements**: Coretax system overhaul by January 2026
- **Credit Growth Target**: Pushing for double-digit lending growth

### Regional Government Responses
- **Transparency Measures**: Direct engagement with BI and BPK for data verification
- **Budget Execution**: Emphasis on legitimate operational requirements
- **Accountability**: Increased focus on demonstrating proper fund utilization

## Conclusion: A Crisis of Fiscal Management

The **Rp653.4 trillion** government fund accumulation represents more than just a financial statisticâ€”it's a symptom of deeper structural issues in Indonesia's fiscal management system. The controversy between Minister Purbaya and Governor Dedi Mulyadi has brought these issues into sharp public focus, forcing both central and regional governments to confront fundamental questions about:

- The balance between fiscal prudence and economic stimulus
- The efficiency of budget planning and execution processes
- The appropriate role of government funds in economic development
- The transparency and accountability of public financial management

As Indonesia navigates these challenges, the resolution of this controversy will likely set important precedents for center-regional fiscal relations and government accountability in the years ahead.
