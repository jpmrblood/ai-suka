# Introduction

In a strategic move to enhance energy security and reduce reliance on imported fuels, the Indonesian government has launched an ambitious Dimethyl Ether (DME) strategy. This initiative aims to transform Indonesia's abundant coal reserves into a clean-burning synthetic fuel alternative through advanced coal gasification technology. The DME strategy represents a critical component of Indonesia's broader coal downstreaming policy, designed to create value-added products from domestic resources while addressing the nation's heavy dependence on imported Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).

This article provides a comprehensive analysis of Indonesia's DME strategy, examining the technological foundations, economic rationale, regulatory framework, and the transformative potential for Indonesia's energy landscape.

# The Strategic Imperative: Why DME Matters for Indonesia

Indonesia's DME strategy emerges from pressing national priorities in energy security, economic development, and environmental sustainability.

## Energy Security and Import Reduction

Indonesia faces a significant challenge with its LPG imports, which constitute approximately **70-80% of its annual demand** of **8-10 million tons**. This heavy reliance on imported LPG creates several critical vulnerabilities:

- **Foreign Exchange Drain**: LPG imports cost Indonesia approximately **$4-5 billion annually**, representing a significant burden on the national budget
- **Supply Chain Risks**: Global LPG price volatility and supply disruptions expose Indonesia to international market fluctuations
- **Energy Independence Gap**: Despite being a major energy producer, Indonesia remains dependent on imported fuels for domestic consumption

## Economic Development Through Coal Downstreaming

The DME strategy leverages Indonesia's vast coal reserves, estimated at **over 200 billion tons**, with low-rank coal comprising a significant portion. This initiative aims to:

- **Create Value-Added Industries**: Transform coal from a basic commodity into high-value chemical products
- **Generate Employment**: Develop new industrial sectors requiring skilled labor and technical expertise
- **Enhance Industrial Competitiveness**: Position Indonesia as a regional leader in coal gasification technology

## Environmental and Technical Advantages

DME offers several key benefits that align with Indonesia's sustainable development goals:

- **Clean-Burning Properties**: DME produces significantly lower emissions compared to conventional fossil fuels
- **Infrastructure Compatibility**: Can be blended with LPG (20-30% ratio) without requiring major infrastructure changes
- **Versatile Applications**: Suitable for household cooking, industrial heating, and potential transportation uses

# Legal Framework and Policy Implementation

## Presidential Regulation No. 109/2020: The Foundation

Indonesia's DME strategy is formalized through **Presidential Regulation No. 109/2020 on the Third Amendment of Presidential Regulation No. 3/2016 on the Acceleration of National Strategic Projects**. This regulation designates DME projects as **National Strategic Projects**, providing them with:

- **Priority Status**: Streamlined permitting and approval processes
- **Investment Incentives**: Tax holidays, import duty exemptions, and other fiscal benefits
- **Government Support**: Land acquisition assistance and regulatory facilitation
