## Background and Policy Objectives

### Addressing Real-Name System Challenges

China's Cyberspace ID was created to address fundamental challenges in the existing real-name verification system that had evolved under the Cybersecurity Law (CSL). Prior to its implementation, internet platforms independently collected and stored users' real identity information, leading to several systemic issues <sup>[1](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2025/china/china-cybersecurity-and-data-protection-monthly-update-june-2025-issue)</sup>:

**Data Security Concerns**
- Personal information was replicated across hundreds of platform databases
- Each platform represented a potential data breach vulnerability
- Limited standardization in data protection measures across services
- Mobile phone numbers and ID information stored in multiple locations

**Regulatory Compliance Gaps**
- Varying interpretations of "necessary" personal information collection
- Inconsistent implementation of data minimization principles
- Challenges in enforcing uniform security standards across platforms

### The Privacy Protection Solution

The Cyberspace ID system introduces a fundamental shift in how personal data is handled during online verification processes. According to Article 8 of the Administrative Measures, the system is designed specifically to protect personal information through technical and administrative means <sup>[2](http://www.news.cn/politics/20250525/938523431e674ba59a1a0cc4dbd348f5/c.html)</sup>:

**Minimal Data Disclosure**
When an internet platform needs to verify a user's real identity information in accordance with the law but doesn't need to retain the user's legal identification document information, the public service platform only provides the user's identity verification results rather than raw identity data.

**Administrative Protection Framework**
This approach represents an administrative-level solution to personal information protection, creating a standardized verification mechanism that reduces the proliferation of sensitive personal data across multiple platforms.

## Technical Architecture and Implementation

### Core Components and Registration Process

The Cyberspace ID system implements a centralized identity model with two primary components that work together to provide secure digital authentication <sup>[3](http://www.news.cn/politics/20250525/938523431e674ba59a1a0cc4dbd348f5/c.html)</sup>:

**Network ID Number ("Web Number" - 网号)**
A unique, lifelong identifier composed of 10 random letters and numbers that corresponds to an individual's real-name information without containing any plaintext personal data. This serves as an anonymous identifier in cyberspace, functioning similarly to a username across different platforms.

**Network ID Certificate ("Web Certificate" - 网证)**
A dynamic digital credential that carries the Web Number and is used for the actual authentication process. Typically displayed as a QR code, this certificate is designed to be unique for each authentication attempt to prevent replay attacks.

### Registration and Authentication Workflow

The system operates through a carefully designed process that balances security with user convenience:

**Enrollment Process:**
1. Users download the official "National Network Identity Authentication" application
2. Identity verification using NFC-enabled phones to read physical ID cards
3. Live facial recognition scan for biometric verification
4. System generates unique Web Number and Web Certificate upon successful verification <sup>[4](http://www.news.cn/politics/20250525/938523431e674ba59a1a0cc4dbd348f5/c.html)</sup>

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Users select Cyberspace ID login on participating platforms
2. Presentation of Web Certificate (typically via QR code scan)
3. Platform verification through the Public Service Platform
4. Access granted based on verification results without sharing raw identity data

## Legal Foundation and Compliance

### Three Pillar Laws Framework

The Cyberspace ID system is built upon China's three fundamental data governance laws:

**Cybersecurity Law (CSL) Compliance**
Article 24 of the CSL mandates real-name verification for network access, which the Cyberspace ID implements through standardized digital credentials rather than fragmented platform-level collection <sup>[5](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2025/china/china-cybersecurity-and-data-protection-monthly-update-june-2025-issue)</sup>.

**Data Security Law (DSL) Integration**
The DSL's data classification system requires the Cyberspace ID to adhere to strict data protection standards, with all processing occurring within China's borders <sup>[6](http://www.news.cn/politics/20250525/938523431e674ba59a1a0cc4dbd348f5/c.html)</sup>.

**Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) Alignment**
The PIPL's data minimization principle is implemented by providing platforms with verification results rather than raw identity data <sup>[7](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2025/china/china-cybersecurity-and-data-protection-monthly-update-june-2025-issue)</sup>.

### Administrative Measures Implementation

The system operates under specific Administrative Measures that define its operational parameters:

**Voluntary Participation Model**
Current implementation maintains voluntary participation for both users and platforms, with measures prohibiting discrimination against alternative verification methods <sup>[8](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2025/china/china-cybersecurity-and-data-protection-monthly-update-june-2025-issue)</sup>.

**Data Protection Protocols**
- Platforms receive only verification results, not raw identity data
- Personal information must be stored within China
- Cross-border data transfers require security assessments
- Collection limited to strictly necessary authentication data <sup>[9](http://www.news.cn/politics/20250525/938523431e674ba59a1a0cc4dbd348f5/c.html)</sup>

## Implementation Status and Metrics

### Current Adoption and Usage

As of the 2025 implementation:
- Official authentication application: **Over 16 million downloads** <sup>[10](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2025/china/china-cybersecurity-and-data-protection-monthly-update-june-2025-issue)</sup>
- Activated Cyberspace IDs: **6 million users** <sup>[11](http://www.news.cn/politics/20250525/938523431e674ba59a1a0cc4dbd348f5/c.html)</sup>
- Authentication processes completed: **12.5 million** <sup>[12](https://www.twobirds.com/en/insights/2025/china/china-cybersecurity-and-data-protection-monthly-update-june-2025-issue)</sup>
