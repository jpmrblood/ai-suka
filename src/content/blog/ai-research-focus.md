# Research Priorities

This section examines the core focus areas and strategic priorities that drive AI research and development in both nations, highlighting their distinct approaches to innovation and technological advancement.

## United States
- U.S. labs and companies prioritize advancing model capabilities alongside safety
- Cutting-edge U.S. models (e.g. GPT-4, Google's models, Anthropic's Claude) focus on sophisticated reasoning, code generation, multimodal inputs, and high accuracy
- Strong emphasis on alignment and robustness (e.g. publishing alignment research, testing for bias)
- Many U.S. releases are open or open-sourced (Meta's LLaMA, Mistral, etc.), reflecting a culture of openness
- The U.S. still outpaces China in model production (61 vs. 15 "notable" foundation models in 2023)[\[1\]](https://itif.org/publications/2024/08/26/how-innovative-is-china-in-ai/#:~:text=While%20China%20leads%20in%20research,compared%20with%2020%20from%20China)), showing its focus on rapid innovation and productization

## China
- China's AI community has made catching up its chief aim, with a focus on high performance (especially in Chinese) and computational efficiency
- Chinese teams have rapidly closed the gap with Western LLMs: Chinese research now exceeds the U.S. in volume and is "rapidly closing the performance gap with U.S. LLMs, especially in bilingual benchmarks"[\[2\]](https://itif.org/publications/2024/08/26/how-innovative-is-china-in-ai/#:~:text=copier%20is%20false%20and%20outdated,LLMs%2C%20especially%20in%20bilingual%20benchmarks)
- Domestic efforts produce powerful open-source models (e.g. Alibaba's Qwen-1.5, Zhipu's ChatGLM3) that have even **outperformed** some U.S. counterparts on standard tasks[\[3\]](https://itif.org/publications/2024/08/26/how-innovative-is-china-in-ai/#:~:text=China%E2%80%99s%20open,recognition%20for%20their%20impressive%20capabilities)[\[4\]](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/06/china-ai-breakthroughs-no-surprise/#:~:text=Open,GPUs%2C%20have%20competed%20successfully%20against)
- Growing interest in multi-domain and industry-tailored models (e.g. Chinese companies openly share mixtures of expert (MoE) models to boost efficiency)
- Chinese priority is on matching U.S. capabilities (often via innovation under resource constraints) and serving local language needs, whereas U.S. priority balances capability with safety and openness

# Government or Regulatory Influence

This section explores how government policies and regulations shape AI development and deployment in both countries, revealing fundamentally different approaches to governance and oversight.

## United States
- The U.S. government has so far avoided content censorship but is actively shaping AI via guidance and funding
- In October 2023, President Biden issued an Executive Order declaring AI must be "safe and secure," requiring **standardized evaluations and risk assessments** before deployment[\[5\]](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=,dangerous%20modifications%2C%20are%20ethically%20developed)
- Federal agencies are issuing many AI-related rules (59 new AI regulations in 2024, more than double the previous year) on issues like algorithmic bias, data privacy, and national security[\[6\]](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report#:~:text=8,on%20AI%E2%80%94with%20regulation%20and%20investment)
- The U.S. also pours public funds into AI R&D (e.g. NSF AI institutes, the CHIPS Act for AI chips, Defense Department AI projects) and maintains export controls (on high-end GPUs) to slow Chinese military uses
- Policy in the U.S. encourages innovation and safety (via standards) but does *not* mandate ideological content filtering, reflecting First Amendment constraints and a market-driven approach

## China
- The Chinese state exerts tight, top-down control over AI development and deployment
- AI is a declared strategic priority (e.g. the 2017 "Next Generation AI Development Plan," and inclusion in five-year plans) with massive state investment
- Most large Chinese AI firms are partially state-backed, and regulations strongly shape what models can do
- In 2023--2024 the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) drafted strict generativeâ€‘AI rules: they require providers to filter out disallowed content and to register models with the government
- Chinese law mandates that outputs must be "true and accurate" and must "embody core socialist values"[\[7\]](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/07/chinas-ai-regulations-and-how-they-get-made?lang=en#:~:text=and%20that%20generated%20content%20be,baseless%20claims%20in%20their%20outputs)[\[8\]](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/07/chinas-ai-regulations-and-how-they-get-made?lang=en#:~:text=boilerplate%20content%20mandates%20,The%20draft%20requires), effectively censoring anything offensive, politically sensitive (e.g. no secessionist or subversive content[\[9\]](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-releases-new-draft-regulations-on-generative-ai/#:~:text=What%20kind%20of%20data%20will,be%20deemed%20%E2%80%98harmful%E2%80%99)), or illegal
- Training data too is regulated: harmful categories (extremism, porn, violent content, etc.) must be excluded[\[9\]](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-releases-new-draft-regulations-on-generative-ai/#:~:text=What%20kind%20of%20data%20will,be%20deemed%20%E2%80%98harmful%E2%80%99), and data must come from diverse sources (with any foreign data mixed with domestic sources)[\[10\]](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-releases-new-draft-regulations-on-generative-ai/#:~:text=Diversity%20in%20training%20data%20sources,text%2C%20images%2C%20audio%2C%20video)
- The Chinese government tightly governs AI via content controls and data rules, both to enforce ideology and to pursue "secure, controllable" AI systems

# Commercial Applications and Industry Focus

This section analyzes how AI technologies are being integrated across different industry sectors in both countries, highlighting key adoption patterns and market strategies.

## United States
- U.S. companies have rapidly integrated LLMs across many sectors with 78% of U.S. organizations using AI in 2024 (up from 55% in 2023)[\[11\]](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report#:~:text=78,skill%20gaps%20across%20the%20workforce), indicating broad adoption
- Tech and finance lead the way (cloud providers offer AI analytics and assistants; Wall Street firms use generative AI for data analysis)
- Consumer uses have exploded as well: chatbots (ChatGPT, Google Bard) are used by tens of millions for everything from writing emails to homework
- In education, AI tutors and writing-assist tools are proliferating (with some debate on academic use)
- Healthcare, legal, and entertainment industries are piloting generative systems for draft reports or creative content
- Even the U.S. military is deploying LLMs: for example, the Army launched an "Enterprise LLM Workspace" (powered by Azure OpenAI, Mistral, Anthropic models, etc.) to automate tasks like drafting press releases and updating personnel records[\[12\]](https://www.army.mil/article/285537/army_launches_army_enterprise_llm_workspace_the_revolutionary_ai_platform_that_wrote_this_article#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%93%20The%20newly%20launched,prompts%20to%20author%20this%20article)
- U.S. industry focus is on productivity gains and new services across both enterprise and consumer markets

## China
- China's LLM ecosystem is dominated by big tech and increasingly active startups, with a focus on domestic enterprise and consumer apps
- Major platforms have embedded AI: Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei all market LLM services via search engines, cloud platforms, social apps, and phones
- The emphasis is on commercial deployment in areas like e-commerce, finance, manufacturing, and education
- Baidu reports some 26,000 enterprises (including Samsung China, Lenovo, Honor) using its Ernie models, and ~200 million consumer user accounts of its Ernie Bot[\[13\]](https://www.nbr.org/publication/chinas-generative-ai-ecosystem-in-2024-rising-investment-and-expectations/#:~:text=enterprise%20users%2C%20including%20Samsung%20China%2C,platform%20and%20created%20190%2C000%20AI)
- Alibaba claims its Qwen LLM is deployed at 90,000 companies across sectors (healthcare, mobility, aerospace, mining, gaming, PCs) and is used by 2.2 million businesses via its Dingtalk app[\[14\]](https://www.nbr.org/publication/chinas-generative-ai-ecosystem-in-2024-rising-investment-and-expectations/#:~:text=match%20at%20L253%20enterprises%20in,its%20corporate%20communications%20app%20Dingtalk)
- Startups are also targeting niches: for instance, TAL Education's MathGPT is trained for math tutoring in EdTech[\[15\]](https://itif.org/publications/2024/08/26/how-innovative-is-china-in-ai/#:~:text=China%E2%80%99s%20large,solving.%5B18)
- Unlike the U.S., the Chinese market sees close coordination with government objectives (e.g. educational outcomes, manufacturing efficiency), and little competition from foreign AI (due to firewalls and regulations)
- China's industry focus is on scaling AI for local languages and industries, leveraging massive data, and aligning with state-driven economic goals[\[16\]](https://www.nbr.org/publication/chinas-generative-ai-ecosystem-in-2024-rising-investment-and-expectations/#:~:text=is%20within%20private,AI%20companies%20and%20AI%20development)[\[13\]](https://www.nbr.org/publication/chinas-generative-ai-ecosystem-in-2024-rising-investment-and-expectations/#:~:text=enterprise%20users%2C%20including%20Samsung%20China%2C,platform%20and%20created%20190%2C000%20AI)

# Training Data

This section compares the data sources, collection methods, and regulatory frameworks that shape how AI models are trained in both countries, revealing fundamental differences in data strategies.

## United States
- U.S. LLMs are typically trained on massive "web-scale" corpora harvested from public English content (Common Crawl, web pages, books, code, etc.)
- For example, GPT-3 (a U.S. model) was trained on ~410 B tokens from Common Crawl (â‰ˆ60% of its data) plus billions of tokens from curated web text, books, and Wikipedia[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3#:~:text=Sixty%20percent%20of%20the%20weighted,261)
- Common Crawl's dataset is about 46% English (and only â‰ˆ5% Chinese)[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Crawl#:~:text=English%20is%20the%20primary%20language,of%20documents.%5B%2010), so U.S. models tend to be English-centric, though many also include multilingual sources
- Data collection is mostly open, subject only to legal limits: public datasets and crawling are routine, and private firms often include licensed proprietary texts
- U.S. companies do filter out illegal or hate content, but there is no government censorship of the training material itself
- Issues like copyright and privacy have arisen (e.g. lawsuits over scraping), but overall U.S. models draw on vast international data with relatively few state-imposed restrictions

## China
- Chinese LLMs train on enormous Chinese-language corpora plus controlled foreign text
- Domestic data (news, books, social media, encyclopedias, government archives, etc.) is front and center -- for example, Baidu's ERNIE 4.5 series was trained on 5.6 trillion tokens of Chinese and English text[\[19\]](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/07/01/baidu-open-sources-ernie-4-5-llm-series-scaling-from-0-3b-to-424b-parameters/#:~:text=ERNIE%204,form%20generation%2C%20and%20reasoning%20benchmarks)
- By law and practice, the content must comply with state rules: the training data must exclude disallowed topics (e.g. violence, pornography, separatism[\[9\]](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-releases-new-draft-regulations-on-generative-ai/#:~:text=What%20kind%20of%20data%20will,be%20deemed%20%E2%80%98harmful%E2%80%99)), and any foreign-sourced data must be "combined with domestic data"[\[10\]](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-releases-new-draft-regulations-on-generative-ai/#:~:text=Diversity%20in%20training%20data%20sources,text%2C%20images%2C%20audio%2C%20video)
- In practice, large Chinese datasets (like the Wudao corpus) are often private to big companies or institutions, and open Chinese corpora are relatively scarcer than English ones[\[20\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.04167v4#:~:text=Pretraining%20data%20is%20essential%20in,caliber%20resources%3B%20however%2C%20their%20limited)
- Chinese teams supplement web data with proprietary sources (e.g. local news, academic corpora, special-purpose datasets)
- Because of the Great Firewall, many Western texts are not used; instead, Chinese models integrate some English and code via partnerships or global sources
- Overall, China relies on heavily curated, homegrown training sets that cover Chinese and key global knowledge while strictly filtering content to meet government censorship and "socialist values" requirements[\[9\]](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-releases-new-draft-regulations-on-generative-ai/#:~:text=What%20kind%20of%20data%20will,be%20deemed%20%E2%80%98harmful%E2%80%99)[\[7\]](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/07/chinas-ai-regulations-and-how-they-get-made?lang=en#:~:text=and%20that%20generated%20content%20be,baseless%20claims%20in%20their%20outputs)

| **Research Priorities**     | Focus on pushing model capability, reasoning, and safety. US institutions released far more foundation models (e.g. 61 vs 15 in 2023[\[1\]](https://itif.org/publications/2024/08/26/how-innovative-is-china-in-ai/#:~:text=While%20China%20leads%20in%20research,compared%20with%2020%20from%20China)) and excel at translating research into products. Emphasis on robust evaluation, ethical alignment, and a vibrant open-source ecosystem (LLaMA, Mistral, etc.).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Focus on closing the capability gap with the West, especially in Chinese. China invests heavily in efficiency (sparse/MoE architectures) and bilingual performance. Chinese teams rapidly advanced open-source LLMs: e.g. Alibaba's Qwen-1.5 and Zhipu's ChatGLM3 outperform some U.S. models[\[3\]](https://itif.org/publications/2024/08/26/how-innovative-is-china-in-ai/#:~:text=China%E2%80%99s%20open,recognition%20for%20their%20impressive%20capabilities)[\[4\]](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/06/china-ai-breakthroughs-no-surprise/#:~:text=Open,GPUs%2C%20have%20competed%20successfully%20against). Alignment/safety research is growing (with "alignment" being a major topic[\[21\]](https://concordia-ai.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/State-of-AI-Safety-in-China-Spring-2024-Report-public.pdf#:~:text=Chinese%20researchers%20are%20showing%20interest,various%20frontier%20AI%20safety%20research)).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Government / Regulation** | No direct censorship of model outputs. The U.S. emphasizes safety and innovation: a 2023 Executive Order demands "safe, secure" AI with pre-deployment testing[\[5\]](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=,dangerous%20modifications%2C%20are%20ethically%20developed). Federal agencies issued 59 AI-related rules in 2024 (vs 23 in 2023) on data use, bias, and national security[\[6\]](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report#:~:text=8,on%20AI%E2%80%94with%20regulation%20and%20investment). Major R&D funding (NIH, NSF, DoD) and export controls (high-end chips) shape the ecosystem.                                                   | Tight state control and content filtering. National AI plans guide industry. New CAC rules (2023--24) require generative AI outputs to be "true and accurate" and to "reflect socialist core values," effectively banning forbidden content[\[7\]](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/07/chinas-ai-regulations-and-how-they-get-made?lang=en#:~:text=and%20that%20generated%20content%20be,baseless%20claims%20in%20their%20outputs)[\[8\]](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/07/chinas-ai-regulations-and-how-they-get-made?lang=en#:~:text=boilerplate%20content%20mandates%20,The%20draft%20requires). Training data must exclude harmful categories (e.g. subversion, obscenity)[\[9\]](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-releases-new-draft-regulations-on-generative-ai/#:~:text=What%20kind%20of%20data%20will,be%20deemed%20%E2%80%98harmful%E2%80%99) and meet diversity requirements[\[10\]](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-releases-new-draft-regulations-on-generative-ai/#:~:text=Diversity%20in%20training%20data%20sources,text%2C%20images%2C%20audio%2C%20video). All AI models must register with regulators and pass security reviews.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Commercial Applications** | Rapid adoption in enterprise and consumer tech. \~78% of U.S. companies use AI tools in 2024[\[11\]](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report#:~:text=78,skill%20gaps%20across%20the%20workforce). Major uses include cloud-based productivity (Microsoft/Google co-pilots), chatbots for service, and creative tools in media and marketing. Finance, healthcare, and education are integrating LLMs (e.g. automated coding, document drafting). Even defense is deploying LLMs (the Army's new LLM Workspace automates press releases and personnel records[\[12\]](https://www.army.mil/article/285537/army_launches_army_enterprise_llm_workspace_the_revolutionary_ai_platform_that_wrote_this_article#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%93%20The%20newly%20launched,prompts%20to%20author%20this%20article)). | Extensive deployment by big tech in web services and apps. Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, etc. embed LLMs in search, e-commerce, and enterprise software. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese businesses use AI: Baidu reported 26,000 corporate users of Ernie Bot and \~200 million overall users[\[13\]](https://www.nbr.org/publication/chinas-generative-ai-ecosystem-in-2024-rising-investment-and-expectations/#:~:text=enterprise%20users%2C%20including%20Samsung%20China%2C,platform%20and%20created%20190%2C000%20AI). Alibaba's Qwen was adopted by 90,000 companies across sectors (healthcare, mobility, aerospace, mining, gaming, PCs) and 2.2 million firms via Dingtalk[\[14\]](https://www.nbr.org/publication/chinas-generative-ai-ecosystem-in-2024-rising-investment-and-expectations/#:~:text=match%20at%20L253%20enterprises%20in,its%20corporate%20communications%20app%20Dingtalk). Niche LLMs (e.g. TAL's MathGPT for education) are emerging[\[15\]](https://itif.org/publications/2024/08/26/how-innovative-is-china-in-ai/#:~:text=China%E2%80%99s%20large,solving.%5B18). Industry focus aligns with state priorities (e.g. smart cities, education), and foreign LLM use is limited by regulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Training Data**           | Trained on massive open corpora: web crawls, books, code, Wikipedia, etc. (e.g. GPT-3 used \~410B tokens from Common Crawl, plus WebText2, books, wiki[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3#:~:text=Sixty%20percent%20of%20the%20weighted,261)). Common Crawl is roughly 46% English and \<6% Chinese[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Crawl#:~:text=English%20is%20the%20primary%20language,of%20documents.%5B%2010), so U.S. models are English-heavy (though many incorporate multilingual data). Data collection is largely unconstrained apart from copyright concerns -- models are free to use public internet content. Companies do filter obviously illegal/harmful material, but there is no state-mandated ideology filter.                                                                   | Trained on vast Chinese-centric data with strict curation. Core training sets come from domestic internet (news archives, social media, Chinese Wikipedia, academic and proprietary databases). Some models (like ERNIE 4.5) combine Chinese with English, but all data must meet government standards. For example, Baidu's ERNIE was trained on 5.6T tokens across Chinese and English domains[\[19\]](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/07/01/baidu-open-sources-ernie-4-5-llm-series-scaling-from-0-3b-to-424b-parameters/#:~:text=ERNIE%204,form%20generation%2C%20and%20reasoning%20benchmarks). However, regulators require excluding "illegal, immoral or unhealthy" content (e.g. crime, pornography, sedition)[\[9\]](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-releases-new-draft-regulations-on-generative-ai/#:~:text=What%20kind%20of%20data%20will,be%20deemed%20%E2%80%98harmful%E2%80%99). Draft AI rules also demand diverse multilingual sources and limits on foreign data[\[10\]](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-releases-new-draft-regulations-on-generative-ai/#:~:text=Diversity%20in%20training%20data%20sources,text%2C%20images%2C%20audio%2C%20video). In practice, much of China's LLM training data is privately held by large companies, and public datasets are fewer and more heavily filtered than in the West[\[20\]](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.04167v4#:~:text=Pretraining%20data%20is%20essential%20in,caliber%20resources%3B%20however%2C%20their%20limited). The result is models trained on huge Chinese-language corpora (and only selected foreign content) under strong censorship constraints. |
