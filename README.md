## üöÄ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts/
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ astro.config.mjs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## üßû Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `bun install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `bun dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `bun build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `bun preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `bun astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `bun astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## üìù Creating Blog Posts

Blog posts are stored as Markdown files in the `src/content/blog/` directory. Each post must follow a specific structure to work properly with the site.

### Title Guidelines

When creating blog post titles, follow these principles for professional, technical writing:

**Preferred Title Style:**
- **Specific and descriptive** - Mention key characteristics (e.g., "Lightweight", "Systematic", "AI-Native")
- **Professional tone** - Avoid sensational language like "Revolutionizing", "Ultimate", "Amazing"
- **Accurate claims** - Don't claim to be "the first" or "the best" unless verifiably true
- **Technical focus** - Emphasize methodology, approach, or specific benefits

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "OpenSpec: Lightweight Change Management for AI-Assisted Development"
- ‚úÖ "Spec Kit: Executable Specifications for Development Teams"
- ‚ùå "OpenSpec: Revolutionizing AI-Driven Development" (too sensational)
- ‚ùå "The Ultimate Guide to Specification-Driven Development" (too generic)

**Title Structure:**
- **[Tool/Project]: [Key Characteristic] [Focus Area] for [Target Audience]**
- Keep under 80 characters for better SEO and readability
- Use title case consistently

### File Structure

1. **Location**: All blog posts go in `src/content/blog/`
2. **File naming**: Use descriptive kebab-case names (e.g., `my-awesome-post.md`)
3. **File extension**: Use `.md` for Markdown files

### Frontmatter Requirements

Each blog post must include the following frontmatter at the top of the file:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "Brief description of your post content"
pubDate: "2025-10-15"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
categories: ["category-name"]
heroImage: "../../assets/year/month/image-name.png"
---
```

### Frontmatter Field Details

| Field | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `title` | Yes | The post title (appears in listings and as page title) | `"My Awesome Blog Post"` |
| `description` | Yes | Brief description (used in meta tags and previews) | `"Learn how to create amazing content"` |
| `pubDate` | Yes | Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format | `"2025-10-15"` |
| `tags` | Yes | Array of relevant tags for the post | `["javascript", "tutorial", "web-dev"]` |
| `categories` | Yes | **Array of categories (maximum 3 per post)** | `["technology"]` |
| `heroImage` | Yes | Path to hero image | `"../../assets/2025/10/hero-image.png"` |

### Important Rules

- **Category Limit**: Each post must not exceed 3 categories. This ensures better organization and navigation.
- **YouTube Content**: When creating articles based on YouTube videos, always include `"youtube"` as one of the categories alongside relevant topic categories (e.g., `["youtube", "prompt-engineering"]`).
- **Image Path**: Hero images should be placed in `src/assets/` with organized folder structure (year/month).
- **Date Format**: Use ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for `pubDate`.
- **Consistent Naming**: Use kebab-case for file names and organize assets logically.

### Content Guidelines

- Write in Markdown format
- Use appropriate heading levels (start with H2 `##` for main sections)
- Include alt text for images
- Keep content focused and well-structured
- Use the established categories from existing posts as reference

**Timeline Markdown Support**
Timeline descriptions support basic markdown formatting for enhanced credibility and readability:

- **Links**: `[Source](https://example.com)` - Creates clickable source citations
- **Bold**: `**important text**` - Emphasizes key information
- **Italic**: `*emphasized text*` - Adds subtle emphasis
- **Combined**: `**Reuters** reported: *"[Source](https://reuters.com)"*` - Complex formatting in one description

### Example Post Structure

```markdown
---
title: "Getting Started with Astro"
description: "Learn the basics of building a blog with Astro framework"
pubDate: "2025-10-15"
tags: ["astro", "tutorial", "static-site"]
categories: ["web-development"]

## üéØ Creating Timeline-Based Articles

Timeline-based articles use the `Timeline` component to create visually engaging chronological content. This is perfect for showcasing project timelines, personal journeys, historical events, or step-by-step processes.

### Timeline Component Usage

To create a timeline-based article, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Timeline Component**

```markdown
import Timeline from "../../components/Timeline.astro";
```

2. **Add Timeline to Your Content**

Place the Timeline component anywhere in your article content:

```markdown
<Timeline
  title="Your Timeline Title"
  items={[
    { year: "2025", title: "Achievement Title", description: "Brief description of what happened.", icon: "icon-name" },
    { year: "2024", title: "Another Event", description: "Another description here.", icon: "another-icon" }
  ]}
/>
```

### Timeline Item Properties

Each timeline item requires the following properties:

| Property | Type | Required | Description | Example |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `year` | string | Yes | The year or time period | `"2025"`, `"Q1 2024"`, `"March 15"` |
| `title` | string | Yes | Main title for the timeline item | `"Launched Blog"` |
| `description` | string | Yes | Detailed description of the event (supports markdown links and formatting) | `"Built my Astro + Tailwind blog. [Source](https://example.com)"` |
| `icon` | string | No | Lucide icon name (without 'Icon' suffix) | `"rocket"`, `"zap"`, `"code"` |

### Available Icons

The Timeline component uses Lucide icons. Popular choices include:

- `rocket` - Launches, new beginnings
- `zap` - Energy, electricity, speed
- `code` - Programming, development
- `palette` - Design, creativity
- `book` - Learning, knowledge
- `star` - Achievements, milestones
- `target` - Goals, objectives
- `users` - Teams, collaboration
- `globe` - Global, international
- `cpu` - Technology, AI

### Timeline Component Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Smooth Animations**: GSAP-powered scroll animations
- **Customizable Icons**: Uses Lucide icon library
- **Flexible Styling**: Integrates with your site's design system
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and smooth transitions

### Best Practices for Timeline Articles

1. **Chronological Order**: Arrange items from oldest to newest or vice versa
2. **Consistent Icons**: Use similar icon types for related events
3. **Clear Descriptions**: Keep descriptions concise but informative
4. **Visual Balance**: Don't overload with too many timeline items
5. **Context Integration**: Introduce the timeline with explanatory text
6. **Mobile-Friendly**: Test timeline appearance on different devices

### Example Timeline Article Structure

```markdown
---
title: "My Development Journey"
description: "A timeline of my programming milestones"
pubDate: "2025-10-19"
tags: ["programming", "career", "timeline"]
categories: ["web-development"]
heroImage: "../../assets/2025/10/journey.png"
---

import Timeline from "../../components/Timeline.astro";

<article class="prose mx-auto">
  <h1>My Development Journey</h1>
  <p>
    Here's how my programming skills and interests have evolved over the years.
  </p>

  <Timeline
    title="Programming Milestones"
    items={[
      { year: "2019", title: "Started Learning", description: "Began with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics.", icon: "book" },
      { year: "2020", title: "First Project", description: "Built my first full-stack web application.", icon: "code" },

      { year: "2022", title: "Mentoring", description: "Started helping other developers learn.", icon: "users" },
      { year: "2023", title: "Advanced Topics", description: "Dived into AI, machine learning, and modern frameworks. [Source](https://example.com/ai-advancement)", icon: "cpu" }
    ]}
  />

  <p>And the learning continues...</p>
